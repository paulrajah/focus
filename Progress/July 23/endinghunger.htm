<h2><a id="aboutus">About Us</a></h2>
<p>FOCUS was established in 1967 at the height of President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty campaign. With a $30,000 government grant, a tenacious founder, Dr. Jose Rosario, and a staff of three, the organization began its work sponsoring educational and developmental programs to improve quality-of-life and promote self-sufficiency within Newark's indigent community. FOCUS' human and financial resources have continually strengthened over the past 45 years, enabling FOCUS to offer a greater variety of services and to help an increasing number of clients.</p>
