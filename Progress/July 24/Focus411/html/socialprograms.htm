<h1>Social Programs</h1>

<h2>Emergency Assistance</h2>
<p>Limited temporary assistance is given to individuals/families facing an emergency or crisis. Those who qualify may receive food vouchers, food packages, rent, and/or utility assistance. Funding is limited, and the demands on the program are extensive, so unfortunately not everyone can receive help, and applicants need to meet all program requirements.</p>

<h2>Adult Protective Servides(APS)</h2>
<P>Adult Protective Services (APS) investigates reports of suspected abuse, neglect, and exploitation of vulnerable adults living in the community. Reports may be made by anyone. When a report is received, APS investigates. If and when the report is confirmed a plan of action is developed with the client to address the situation.<P>
