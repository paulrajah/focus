<p>
        What's new with FOCUS? Stimulated by the phenomenal growth of Hispanics in the United States, as stated in a report published by the United States Census in July of 2012, FOCUS has developed a strategy to guide Hispanics on how to prepare to capitalize on that growth and become a more significant contributor to mainstream America. This strategy is a combined effort of FOCUS' Board of Trustees, its management staff and assistance from other progressive Hispanic community based organizations. 
        To accomplish this goal, FOCUS will utilize current advance technology, available professional assistance, volunteers from the business sector and institutions of higher education. Ultimately, this effort should set the pace for the collaborative groups from the non-profit sector to become less dependable on government and foundation grants, becoming more reliable in productive business endeavors. To fully accomplish this objective, we invite individuals and members of the private sector and other institutions interested in benefiting from this dramatic Hispanic growth and transformation of America to join FOCUS' ambitious efforts as a partner.
